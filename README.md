Aegis is a new programming language designed from the ground up to be **declarative, safe, and ergonomic**. Its primary goal is to make building beautiful, high-performance, native Android applications radically simple and enjoyable. It features a simple, conversational syntax, a powerful type system, and a groundbreaking **compile-time reactivity model** that automates UI updates with maximum performance.

## Core Principles

The development of Aegis is guided by five foundational principles:

* **‚ú® Joyful Creation:** The entire development experience, from syntax to error messages and tooling, should be a delight.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Inevitable Safety:** The language's design and type system should prevent common errors at compile-time, not runtime.
* **üîó Seamless Reality:** Interacting with other platforms and languages (like JavaScript and Python) should feel like a natural, first-class feature.
* **üéØ Principle of Intention:** You should declare *what* you want your UI and logic to do, and the compiler should handle the complex *how*.
* **üìà Scalable Simplicity:** The language should be easy for beginners to learn but powerful enough for complex, large-scale applications.

## Current Status (v0.1.0-alpha)

> **Note:** Aegis is currently in an **alpha** stage. The compiler is functional but supports a subset of the language's full feature set. This repository contains the prototype compiler and the complete vision for the language.

The `v0.1.0-alpha` prototype can successfully compile Aegis code‚Äîincluding `let's` statements, `if/else`, `for` loops, `contract`s, and a full UI definition‚Äîinto a native Android project shell with working, reactive UI.

Key project documents:
* **[üìñ The Official Language Guide](./docs/guide.md)**
* **[üìú The v1.0 Grammar Specification](./specification/aegis-v1.0-grammar.md)**
* **[üó∫Ô∏è The Project Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)**

## Getting Started

The Aegis toolchain, **The Forge**, is not yet available on package managers, but the intended workflow is simple.

#### 1. Installation (Future)
```bash
# On macOS or Linux via Homebrew
brew install aegis-forge
