Aegis is a new programming language designed from the ground up to be **declarative, safe, and ergonomic**. Its primary goal is to make building beautiful, high-performance, native Android applications radically simple and enjoyable.

### Project Status (v0.2.0-alpha)

Aegis is currently in active development with a solid foundation in place. The project has evolved beyond the initial prototype phase and now includes:

#### âœ… Completed Features
- **Complete Compiler Pipeline**: Lexer (Scribe), Parser (Architect), and Semantic Analyzer (Guardian)
- **Language Core**: Variables (`let's`), functions, control flow, and type system
- **Android UI Framework**: Declarative UI components with reactive state management
- **JavaScript Interoperability**: Working bridge for calling JavaScript from Aegis
- **Language Server**: Basic LSP implementation with syntax highlighting and error reporting
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 1,179+ lines of tests covering all compiler components

#### ðŸš§ Current Focus (v0.5)
- Expanding the standard library with essential container types
- Enhancing semantic analysis and type checking
- Improving developer tooling and IDE integration

#### ðŸŽ¯ Upcoming (v1.0)
- Complete language feature set with all 19 core container types
- Production-ready Android code generation
- Full package manager and testing framework
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
