# 🗺️ Aegis Project Roadmap

Welcome to the official roadmap for the Aegis programming language and toolchain. This document outlines our major milestones, tracks our progress, and communicates our priorities for future development. It is a living document that will evolve with the project and community feedback.

---
## ✅ v0.2: The Foundation (Completed)

This milestone represents the successful creation of a complete, end-to-end prototype of the Aegis compiler and its core features. All major architectural components are in place.

- [x] **Core Compiler:** A fully functional pipeline (Scribe, Architect, Guardian, Engine) written in Rust.
- [x] **Language Core:** Support for variables (`let's`), functions, `if/else`, `for` loops, and `when` expressions.
- [x] **Type System:** A foundational system with `contract`s, type inference, and `async/await` validation.
- [x] **Project Nexus (UI Framework):** A complete prototype for the Android target, including:
    - [x] A declarative component model (`column`, `text`, `button`, etc.).
    - [x] A compile-time reactivity model (`let's track`).
    - [x] A type-safe styling system.
    - [x] High-performance list rendering (`for` loops -> `RecyclerView`).
- [x] **The Bridge:** A working JavaScript interoperability bridge using a native JNI library.
- [x] **Tooling:** A basic language server (LSP) and a functional CLI (`aegis new`, `aegis build`).

## 🚀 v0.5: The Hardening (Current Focus)

With the foundation in place, this milestone is focused on improving the stability, utility, and developer experience of the existing feature set.

- [x] **Implement Comprehensive Test Suite**
    - [x] Design and implement test cases for all compiler components (Lexer, Parser, Semantic Analysis).
    - [x] Build automated test runner with detailed reporting.
    - [x] Implement performance benchmarking and error handling tests.
    - [x] Create cross-platform test execution scripts (1,179 lines of test code).
- [ ] **Implement the Test Runner (`aegis test`)**
    - [ ] Design the syntax for writing tests in Aegis.
    - [ ] Build the test runner into the Forge CLI.
- [ ] **Expand the Standard Library**
    - [ ] Add more essential methods to `List` and `Map`.
    - [ ] Implement new core containers like `Tuple` and `Set`.
- [ ] **Harden the Guardian (Semantic Analyzer)**
    - [ ] Implement full type checking for `contract` initializers (`let's user: User = {...}`).
    - [ ] Improve the precision and helpfulness of type error messages.
- [ ] **Enhance the Language Server (LSP)**
    - [ ] Implement "Go to Definition".
    - [ ] Implement general autocompletion for keywords and in-scope variables.

## 🌟 v1.0: First Public Release (Upcoming)

This milestone represents our goal for a stable, feature-rich version of Aegis ready for a wider audience.

- [ ] **Language Feature Complete:**
    - [ ] Implement all 19 core container types.
    - [ ] Implement full exhaustiveness checking for `when` expressions.
- [ ] **Android Backend Complete:**
    - [ ] Move from a prototype to a production-ready code generator.
    - [ ] Support for all major Android lifecycle events in the `change` block.
- [ ] **Tooling Complete:**
    - [ ] A robust and feature-rich test runner.
    - [ ] A basic package manager (`aegis add <package>`).
    - [ ] A stable and performant language server.
- [ ] **Documentation Complete:**
    - [ ] A full, book-like guide with comprehensive examples.
    - [ ] Complete API reference for the standard library.

## 🌌 Future & Vision (Post-1.0)

These are the long-term ambitions for the Aegis project, solidifying its place as a truly universal language.

- [ ] **Project Nexus Expansion:**
    - [ ] Target iOS via a Swift/SwiftUI code generator.
    - [ ] Target the Web via a WebAssembly/WASM-DOM code generator.
    - [ ] Explore Desktop support (e.g., via Compose Multiplatform).
- [ ] **The Bridge Expansion:**
    - [ ] Implement the Python bridge for data science and scripting.
    - [ ] Implement the Rust/C++ bridge for high-performance native libraries.
- [ ] **Performance & Optimization:**
    - [ ] A dedicated compiler pass for optimizing AIL (Aegis Intermediate Language).
    - [ ] Advanced rendering strategies for the UI backend.
- [ ] **Aegis Synapse:**
    - [ ] An integrated, beginner-friendly machine learning library.
