# Aegis Compiler Test Suite - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive test suite for the Aegis compiler that evaluates both performance and correctness across all compiler components. The test suite is designed to provide clear reporting on how well the compiler handles various scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.
