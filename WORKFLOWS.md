**Purpose**: Comprehensive security and compliance monitoring

#### Features:
- **Security audit**: Daily vulnerability scanning with cargo-audit
- **License compliance**: Automated license checking and reporting
- **Dependency review**: PR-based dependency change analysis
- **Supply chain security**: cargo-deny integration for policy enforcement
- **Update tracking**: Reports on outdated dependencies

#### Key Benefits:
- Proactive security vulnerability detection
- License compliance assurance
- Dependency management automation

### Release Automation (`release.yml`)
**Triggers**: Version tags, Manual dispatch  
**Purpose**: Automated release creation and distribution

#### Features:
- **Multi-platform binaries**: Linux, macOS, Windows builds
- **Docker images**: Container distribution via GitHub Container Registry
- **Automated changelogs**: Git history-based release notes
- **Asset management**: Binary packaging and distribution
- **Installation scripts**: User-friendly installation automation

#### Key Benefits:
- Consistent release process
- Professional distribution
- Reduced manual release overhead

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

### Enhanced Devcontainer
**File**: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

#### Features:
- **Rust-optimized environment**: Pre-configured Rust development setup
- **VS Code extensions**: rust-analyzer, testing tools, GitHub integration
- **Development tools**: cargo-audit, cargo-watch, debugging tools
- **Automated setup**: Post-creation environment configuration

### Development Scripts
**Location**: `scripts/` and `.devcontainer/setup.sh`

#### Available Scripts:
- `dev-setup.sh`: Initial development environment setup
- `benchmark.sh`: Performance benchmarking
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Development aliases and shortcuts

## üîß Configuration & Customization

### Workflow Customization
Each workflow is designed to be modular and can be customized:

1. **Platform targets**: Modify matrix strategies in `ci-enhanced.yml`
2. **Security policies**: Update `security.yml` for custom rules
3. **Release assets**: Customize binary generation in `release.yml`
4. **Documentation**: Modify doc generation in `docs.yml`

### Environment Variables
Key environment variables used across workflows:
- `CARGO_TERM_COLOR=always`: Colorized output
- `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`: Enhanced error reporting
- Component-specific feature flags

### Secrets Required
For full functionality, configure these secrets:
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Code coverage reporting
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Built-in, used for releases and pages

## üìà Monitoring & Metrics

### Available Metrics:
- **Test Coverage**: Via Codecov integration
- **Security Posture**: Daily vulnerability reports
- **Performance Trends**: Benchmark tracking over time
- **Build Success Rates**: Multi-platform compatibility
- **Dependency Health**: Update and security status

### Dashboard Access:
- GitHub Actions tab for workflow status
- GitHub Pages for documentation
- Codecov dashboard for coverage trends
- Security tab for vulnerability reports

## ü§ù Contributing
